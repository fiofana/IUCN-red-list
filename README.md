# IUCN-red-list ðŸ”´

This project aims to analyze species occurrence data to assess biodiversity patterns, identify hotspots, and understand the impact of environmental factors on species distribution. This is my first Data Science project and I intend to better my skills by working on the project and continuing to improve it.

## Data
The project utilizes data obtained from: 
1. IUCN (2022). The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2022-2. https://www.iucnredlist.org. Downloaded on 2023-05-09. https://doi.org/10.15468/0qnb58 accessed via GBIF.org on 2023-11-17. accessed via GBIF.org on 2024-01-08.

## Results
1. The dataset is rich in data from Animalia and Plantae groups, but very lacking in regards of Chromista data.
2. Tracheophytra and Chordata are the phyla with most entries by far, even wihtin their own kingdom, which may express a bias towards the species in these phyla in the dataset.
3. Most species (59.49%) in the dataframe are in the "Least Concern" level of endangerment.
